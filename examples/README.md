# A helping hand or inspirational source

The purpose of this directory is to show you how extensions can be build using Kerberos Vault. The examples are not production ready, which means additional validations, and appropriate tests might need to be added. Other than that, it can be a good starting point.

# List of examples

- [Kafka Handler](kafka-handler): Retrieve real-time Kerberos Vault events from a Kafka broker, fetch recording from Kerberos Vault and execute an algorithm. [Python]
