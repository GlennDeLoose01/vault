The purpose of this directory is to show you how extensions can be build using Kerberos Storage. The examples are not production ready, which means additional validations, and appropriate tests might need to be added. Other then that, it can be a good starting point.

# List of examples

- [Kafka Handler](kafka-handler): Retrieve real-time Kerberos Storage events from a Kafka broker, fetch recording from Kerberos Storage and execute an algorithm. [Python]
